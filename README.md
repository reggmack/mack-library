# mack-library
JS library project

Pitfalls:
Trying to code too many steps without committing. Need to work on one small step at a time and commit more often.

Got stuck for 2 days trying to figure out why adding new books displayed the new array on top of the old array instead of just appending it. All I need to do was clear the displaying divs contents before rendering the array again...damn!
